// Define the Controller and implement the Scope which links HTML
// elements to variables in the Scope. It receives the controller
// name and a factory function which gets the controller ready to use
// We are saying that $scope is a dependency and that we want Angular
// to pass in the $scope object when the function is called. This is
// an example of dependency injection. Angular sees that my factory
// function contains the $scope component and then it gets it and passes
// it to the function automatically.
